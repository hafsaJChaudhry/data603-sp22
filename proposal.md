# Big Data and Social Media 

## what it is: 
Big Data is dealing with and analyzing large chunks of data through non-traditional data processing applications. It is a recent phenomenon, and when merged with another phenomenon called social media, can combine to create an endless realm of possibility. The combine merging is being known as social media mining, and similary to mining for gold, can achieve large amounts of money for those who own the equipment. 
## why it's important: 
We as consumers are highly valuable to brokers, marketers, and sellers of big companies and small companies alike. What we value, our interests, what we are willing to spend money on and what we "click" are all deemed as profitable to companies. However, they no longer have to rely on chance and exposure alone, and can accurately curate advertisements and clicks based on the big data surrounding our social media experience, which in turn will sky rocket a companies sales.
