## A Comparison of NoSQL Database Management Systems and Models

This article covers an overview of non-relational data models, otherwise known as NoSQL, and the current uses and skills for each model. Along with examples and scenarios of when to use the different data models. Specifically, when to use the key-value store, columnar database, document store, and graph database. In general, NoSQL holds many different forms and has new models being added to it. The article also covers the origin of such database category, and how it differs from the traditional relational database which holds limitations that NoSQL can overcome such as consistency and structure. In contrast, NoSQL can handle inconsistent data such as when performing horizontal scaling and scaling out, while also handling unstructured data such as emails, texts, photos, and videos. 


## Introduction to Data Lakes
This article covers data lakes; what it is, why you'd need them, the challenges it faces, and how the lakehouse solves these challenges along with how to build a lakehouse. To summarize, a data lake is a method to store large data in its raw form by assigning the data with tags and identifiers. It differs from the traditional way of storing data by not organizing the data into categories such as files and folders, instead, it uses object storage and open formats. You would use data lakes to enable things such as "centralize, consolidate, and catalog your data" and "quickly and integrate diverse data sources" etc. But it faces reliability issues, slow performances, and lacks security features. The article offers the solution of the lakehouse, which uses all the same features but operates directly through the cloud.
