# The Battle Against Social Media Algorithms 

## what it is: 
The phenomenon of social media has taken over the world, with users being both young and old. But the effictiveness of each platform isnt by chance or random, but instead carefully developed and deployed by algorithms, known as social media algorithms. These algorithms are responsible for bringing in AND keeping user interaction, this in turn, proves to be extremely fruitful as seen by the rise of each multi-billion dollar social media platforms. But how are these algorithms developed, and how are they in comparison to each other? 


## Social Media Platforms in Discussion: 
include paragraph talking about the most grossed platforms and the intention and use of each platform. Explain WHY these algorithms are so important to each platform (interaction, relevance, money, partnerships, etc) and how the algorithm is used in order for each platform to compete against one another in user-interaction ownership. 


## Facebook
include algorithms use and how it was created
algorithms focus (popularity, relationship, content type, meaningful interaction)
key signals for algorithm 

## Instagram
include algorithms use and how it was created, compare to facebooks algorithm
algorithms focus (date posted, liklihood of "like", past interaction) 
key signals for algorithm (relevance, resonance, recency)

## TikTok 
include algorithms use and how it was created, compare to both facebook and instagrams algorithm
talk about TikTok's unique use of AI as the main algorithmic source
key signals for algorithm

## Historical changes in algorithm 
facebook's change in algorithm to "meaningful interaction" which created a shift in businesses making advertisments etc. how its not viewed as a user profitable platform as much.

## Other noteworthy platforms and how they compare to the 3 above 

## Diagram, pictures, models 
will include periodically per paragraph above or only in this paragraph to clearly visualize the compare and contrast
