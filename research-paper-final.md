# The Battle Against Social Media Algorithms

## Topic: 
The phenomenon of social media has taken over the world, with users being both young and old. But the effectiveness of each platform isn't by chance or random, but instead carefully developed and deployed by **algorithms**, known as **social media algorithms**. These algorithms are responsible for bringing in AND keeping user interaction. But how are these algorithms developed, and how are they in comparison to each other? This paper will explore different algorithm layouts, as well as cover the negative connotation of using algorithms to curate shared content. 

## Relevance to Data Science:
With the high saturation of smartphone usage (and with conventional media become obsolete) came the phenomenon of data being shared and accessed online.

Possessing and analyzing data for predicting and leveraging trends is an extremely crucial aspect for businesses in our modern digital world.  It is expected that by 2024, the data science market will reach 140.9 billion USD [^1] , amongst the highest contributors being social media platforms. 
The influx of user data being shared provides for algorithms to: 
- track user data 
- organize and curate personal and targeted content
- provide targeted marketing advertisements 

## What it is: 
An algorithm is mathematical expression used to describe how a group of data behaves [^2]. Within the scope of social media, an algorithm is used to sort content in user's feed by filtering out irrelevant data and ranking high quality data first [^2] . Emphasizing on the concept of **relevance**.  
> Before algorithms, social media platforms would display user feed based on chronological order. 

Algorithms vary per platform, with each platform providing a different user experience. Allowing for a comparison of algorithms per social media brand.

## Facebook 
Facebook's main goals of algorithm is to create engagement with local, familial, and friendly posts. 
> **algorithm ranking key**: popularity, relationship, content type, relevance. 

Emphasis on **meaningful interactions** rather than likes. Facebook's algorithm would rather a user comment and write a post on someone's feed than to just leave a reaction. 

This shift in algorithm has moved businesses away from using facebook as a means to make money. 

**![How Do Social Media Algorithms Work?](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/MFa9hOqVjogU2PEiGmmq-DmME9RIpeGn82dCvsBdxgIVDA9dSm9K70OYVBscjmwxHpHOujqx6fVwZ5C1UMrluTlJdYaYTpgnVzwDEdIjkeqQ3zlOeT6Ma2wzN0wmt64xLMkW-ZzEAklH17fc6w)**
Algorithm brainchildren of Facebook include DeepText and DeepFace to analyze data and extract meaning from them.[^1] 
> **DeepText**: interprets and finds correlations between large amounts of text from user interaction by using Deep Neural Networks and NLP. Then suggest videos or posts to user. 
> **DeepFace**: facial recognition algorithm used in photo sharing. Allows for users to be tagged automatically and suggest "people you may know" based on the face recognition patters of your social circle. 
> 
## Instagram 
Owned by Facebook, Instagram also uses DeepText and DeepFace to leverage the power of data analytics [^1] . It uses Deeptext to refine search keywords and filter spam messages and uses machine learning wonder embedding to recommend and organize posts on a user's feed. 

Instagram's main algorithmic goal is **relevance**.  
> **algorithm ranking key** [^3] : liklihood user is interested in content, date content was shared, past interactions with poster, following, and session time. 

Originally, Instagram used to post photos chronilogically. However, the shift to user relevance has been fruitful to user interaction ratings as well as to marketers. No longer are users bombarded with photos of everyone they know, ranging from their best friend to a classmate they haven't seen in years. But rather, shown a personalized feed of their following postings based on their interactions with that follower.  

Likewise, advertisements on stories are carefully placed based on the liklihood that the user will be interested. Similarly, instagram influencers are shown to a user based on the liklihood that the user will be interested in their content. 

## TikTok
TikTok is the world's fastest growing entertaining platform. From May 2020, it is the most downloaded app worldwide [^4] , reaching popularity heights in half the time of other social media giants. 

Unique to other platforms, tiktok doesn't recommend what to watch but rather **displays videos** to users based on their AI algorithm. 
> “TikTok is the first mainstream consumer app where **artificial intelligence IS the product.** It’s representative of a broader shift.” ~ Connie Chan [^4] 

Unlike other platforms, you do not need a large following to go **viral**. Every video published has a chance to gain traction, this is done purposely to intice more user interaction. Additionally, TikTok also **lowers barriers of entry** by allowing you to use the app as soon as you download it prior to making an account. 

TikTok's Artificial Intelligence Algorithm is mainly used for: 
- analyzing videos once posted to understand the context, thus automatically promoting it to other user's based on the user's metrics data (location, internet history, age). 
- increasingly learn more about the user everytime user uses the app. 
 -  taking notes of user interaction through:  rewatch rate, completion rate, shares, comments, and likes

> **Algorithm's Key Note**: AI creates a cycle that keeps users hooked. If user doesn't finish watching video shown by AI, then the AI takes a step back to watch user behavior. Then it restarts a new cycle of displayed videos. As well as boosting user's own published videos to encourage user to post more. 
> 
> Therefor, it dictates what you watch based on your own interests, and even if your video was not successful, it will hunt down users that will be more likely to leave a reaction, to motivate you to stay on the app. Creating an obsessive user experience cycle. [^4]

## Other Note Worthy Platforms + Algorithms: 
**Pinterest** -> algorithm displays similar content to previous user search or user interaction. 
**LinkedIn** -> algorithm focused on networking by emphasizing relevance and promoting user engagement. 
**Twitter** -> algorithm uses date posted + relevance together. Encourages users to be consistent with tweets, engage with commentary, and post at optimal time to see the most traction. 

## Backlash of Social Media Algorithms 
Though data science web articles mainly cover the logistics and excitment behind these algorithms, journal articles related to this topic tend to have more negative connotations. They explore the reality of daily life being controlled and manipulated by computer programs and the effects it has on human social development. 

Though we mainly talked about personal user posts, such as content of themselves and families, and influencer or marketing posts, social media platforms are also being used to share information. News, ideas, graphic videos are being shared unfiltered for the first time in human history. Often dubbed as "the world's free press", algorithms based on relevance and filtering becomes a concern for users who feel like they are not able to find meaningful information and instead bombarded with posts that are meant to be attention-grabbing [^5].  

![Most think social media does not accurately reflect society](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/PI_2018.11.16_Attitudes-Toward-Algorithms_2-01.png)

In addition, emphasis on user interaction has made some experts believe that negative or harmful posts, such as "misinformation, sensationalism or 'hate clicks'"[^5] are being pushed to users in order for them to stay engaged. Yet the engagement comes at a cost of the users own mental health. 

![Social media users experience a mix of positive, negative emotions while using these platforms](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/PI_2018.11.16_Attitudes-Toward-Algorithms_2-02.png)
![Larger share of young social media users say these platforms frequently make them feel amused - but also lonely and depressed](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/PI_2018.11.16_Attitudes-Toward-Algorithms_2-03.png)

There is a rise in the public who believe that social media data manipulation through the use of analytic algorithms are negatively impacting society and are calling for regulation changes. However, 
> "the regulation of digital information privacy is dependent on national differences and systems and difficult to implement and enforce across jurisdictional boundaries" [^6]

## Recap
We have discussed what an algorithm is, the high relevance of social media algorithms with the future of data science, the main algorithmic goal and usage of current social media giants, as well as the backlash of the use of algorithms to analyze human data. 
> **Main Take Aways**:
> 1. algorithms are employed by platforms to keep a user engaged 
> 2. algorithms organize content feed
> 3. all platforms use some level of user relevance to keep interest high
> 4. TikTok has a high payoff by switching from recommended algorithms to AI algorithm product 
> 5. Not all user interaction is positive
> 6. A rise in algorithms to be regulated, however regulation is unlikely
